# Introduction 
This project is a reimaginging of Doug Finke's [NameIt project](https://github.com/dfinke/NameIT) with a more specific focus. While the initial intent was to simply contribute to his own project, Doug is presently busy with other items in his life,
so this offshoot was born. While this project will no doubt leverage some of the ideas, and possibly even some code snippets, from Doug's work, the intent is to build a ground up rework, with more focus on the core goal... to generate generic usable 
data, rather than ames.

# Getting Started

1.	Installation process
    At present, installation requires first downloading a copy of the repo, creation of the appropriate module directory (DataGen) and version subfolder, then copy in the plugins and src folders, as well as the DataGen psd1 and psm1 files. This module
    will hopefully be released to the PowerShell gallery at some later point. 
2.	Software dependencies
    All dependencies are included as part of the plugins folder content, and at this time is limited to the PSFramework module, which provides the underlying framework for the core module logging and other features
3.	Latest releases
    This is the initial release, though do keep an eye on the ChangeLog for future updates.
