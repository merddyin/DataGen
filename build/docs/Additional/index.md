# DataGen

Dynamically creates data elements, such as people, identities, companies, etc, for use in labs, POCs, and demo/dev environments.

## What is DataGen?

This module serves as an extensible framework that can dynamically generate generalized data sets that are functionality usable for various purposes. This
module was inspired, in part, by Doug Finke's NameIT project, though this tool will have a more targeted purpose.

## Why use the DataGen Module?

This module can be utilized to generate various aspects of data sets needed for different purposes. Unlike many other data generators however, this one generates
more realistic and comprehensive data sets. Need to set up an Active Directory lab with users that are more realistic seeming than 'labuser1', 'labuser2'...., then
this is the tool for you. Generate a company worth of users, with separate names, locations, profile details, even reporting data and titles. Further, the tool is
an extensible framework, so if it doesn't generate the type of data set you need, it can be augmented.

### Features

- Extensible framework module that contains 'libraries' for each type of data set to be generated
- Simple execution with realistic looking data, drawn from real generalized data sets and randomized for your purposes
- Generate user information, to include associated secure passwords, for population of AD or your own user database
- Generate company profiles, with fake addresses that are based in real cities, with real general latitude and longitude for geo-location
- Generate people profile for general marking simulations, with distribution across a single city, a country, a contininent, or anywhere in the world

## Installation

DataGen must currently be downloaded and installed directly from the available repository link.
