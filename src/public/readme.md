# Public Functions

This is the folder where your individual publicly available functions should be placed. Depending on the complexity
of your module, you may wish to separate content into subfolders. 

The module will pick up all .ps1 files recursively at load time, and all functions found here will be exported for 
use as public functions/cmdlets.
